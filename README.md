# Project

Test your cinematic knowledge with Screened, a daily movie guessing game designed to challenge and entertain! Each day, players are given 4 attempts to identify the featured movie of the day, using a top Letterboxd review for the secret movie, and clues revealed with each guess.

# Features

Make Your Guesses: Enter a movie title to start. Each guess reveals how closely your entry matches the correct movie based on key attributes like genre, director, release date, and rating.

Track Your Streaks: The game saves your progress and streaks using local storage, encouraging you to play daily and maintain your winning streak.

Daily Challenges: Each day brings a new mystery movie, resetting the challenge and keeping the experience fresh.
