Taxi Driver,Martin Scorsese,Drama,Crime,Robert De Niro,1976,4.2,Andrew Boley,5.0,"I find it strange that this movie is so popular. I see 'bros' quoting it and they always have this next to Goodfellas and The Sopranos and Entourage in their collection of movies(as do I). I think a lot of people like it for the wrong reasons. They like the violence and the guns and DENIRO. But for me this is the quintessential art house film: ambiguous in it's meaning, a meandering story with no plot in sight, a protagonist that has more psychological disorders than Edward Norton in Fight Club and every character except the Presidential campaign’s employees are completely fucked up. But I'm not giving these 'bros' enough credit, maybe they feel just as lonely as Travis Bickle and… more",https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/5/1/9/4/7/51947-taxi-driver-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=3ae07cca2d,2025-01-11
