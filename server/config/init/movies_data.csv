The Batman,Matt Reeves,4.0,nick wibert,4.0,I just love how fucking disgusting Bruce looks in this. Nasty ass stringy ass translucently pale goth boy in his dank disgusting batcave hunched over his computer with bloodshot eyes and black eye paint scrolling through footage of the previous night and journaling his fucked up thoughts. When he finally emerges from the cave to talk to Alfred and gets disturbed by the natural sunlight and has to put on sunglasses I wanted to get up and cheer.

The Shining,Stanley Kubrick,4.2,👽 Zara 👽,5.0,"shelley duvall's performance in this film is one of the most intense and realistic portrayals of fear and terror i've ever seen and her skilled acting brought me to tears.
the fact that shelley duvall is constantly overlooked when ever i see anyone talk about this film is a fucking crime, especially considering the mental and emotional abuse kubrick caused her so she could maintain a realistic performance and critics didn't even mention her once upon this film's release, it's fucking disgraceful.
seriously, the lack of praise shelley has gotten in comparison to jack nicholson and other actors in the film is astounding and a goddamn crime.

Taxi Driver,Martin Scorsese,4.2,Andrew Boley,5.0,"I find it strange that this movie is so popular. I see 'bros' quoting it and they always have this next to Goodfellas and The Sopranos and Entourage in their collection of movies(as do I). I think a lot of people like it for the wrong reasons. They like the violence and the guns and DENIRO. But for me this is the quintessential art house film: ambiguous in it's meaning, a meandering story with no plot in sight, a protagonist that has more psychological disorders than Edward Norton in Fight Club and every character except the Presidential campaign’s employees are completely fucked up. But I'm not giving these 'bros' enough credit, maybe they feel just as lonely as Travis Bickle and… more",2025-01-06
