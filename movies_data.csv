the fact that shelley duvall is constantly overlooked when ever i see anyone talk about this film is a fucking crime, especially considering the mental and emotional abuse kubrick caused her so she could maintain a realistic performance and critics didn't even mention her once upon this film's release, it's fucking disgraceful.

If watching this served any good purpose, it's a possibly vital reminder that the Clinton era was not as progressive as many of us might like to remember - the latter half of the 20th century in America through the eyes of a reactionary, nearly 50 years of social tumult regarded as just a brief phase of unrest before everything returns to 'normal,' - the Vietnam War, Black Panthers, and social justice activists regarded as a big joke, Jenny's character is subtly demonised - every decision she makes is the 'wrong' one, she doesn't find happiness until she bends to Forrest's will - Forrest is always 'right' - even though he does nothing but observe.",2024-12-15

I see 'bros' quoting it and they always have this next to Goodfellas and The Sopranos and Entourage in their collection of movies(as do I). I think a lot of people like it for the wrong reasons. They like the violence and the guns and DENIRO. But for me this is the quintessential art house film: ambiguous in it's meaning, a meandering story with no plot in sight, a protagonist that has more psychological disorders than Edward Norton in Fight Club and every character except the Presidential campaign’s employees are completely fucked up. But I'm not giving these 'bros' enough credit, maybe they feel just as lonely as Travis Bickle and… more",2025-01-09
